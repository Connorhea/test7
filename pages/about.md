## About the Collection

The topic I want to embark upon for my digital exhibition is an exploration of theNiagara region as told through its advertisements. I plan on gatheringadvertisements from newspapers and other sources that were published in theNiagara region or from companies based in Niagara. By analyzing these images, Ibelieve I can learn more about the region by seeing why a company would use acertain image to display a certain emotion. Why would a company that wants tobe associated with serenity use a depiction of an Indigenous person? What doesthat tell us about the society and their expectations at the time? The aim of theexhibition ultimately being to create a insight of the region through theintentions and depictions of companyâ€™s through their advertisements.
